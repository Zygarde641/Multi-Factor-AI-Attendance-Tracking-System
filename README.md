# AI-Powered-Multi-Factor-Attendance-System-QR-Facial-Recognition-IP-Self-Verification
The AI-Powered Smart Attendance System is a highly secure and intelligent multi-factor authentication attendance system that eliminates the possibility of proxy attendance through QR Code-based authentication, AI-driven facial recognition, and IP self-verification. This system ensures that only authorized students can mark their attendance by following a structured validation process.

Upon login, students are required to scan a unique QR code, which then undergoes real-time IP address validation to ensure location authenticity. After passing the IP check, the system implements a 5-minute time-restricted verification window, preventing unauthorized late entries. Finally, AI-powered facial recognition is performed using FaceNet and OpenCV, ensuring that only the registered student can mark attendance.

This system is built to provide seamless, automated, and foolproof attendance tracking, leveraging cutting-edge AI, cloud storage, and database technologies.
